# Comparative Analysis of Prostate MRI Image Segmentation: Watershed, U-Net, SegNet, and SegFormer Approaches

In this project, we explore the performance of different approaches to the segmentation of the central gland and peripheral zones of the prostate. We include older approaches such as the Watershed algorithm up to state of the art visual transformers such as fine-tuning a SegFormer model, which achieves close to state-of-the-art performance.
